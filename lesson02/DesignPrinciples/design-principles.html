               <h5>Instagram</h5>
               <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">instagram.com</a>
                <p>Instagram's mobile and desktop views are a great way to show visual hierarchy. Instagram does a good job incorporating scale, color, alignment and various images that catch a viewers eye.
                    One of my favorite parts of visual hierarchy shown in the photo above, are the circles beneath the navigation menu. These circles demonstrate alignment, as well as contrast between the 
                    various pictures.

                <p>When looking for a Rule of Thirds example, I thought that a photography page would be nice. Good photographers use the Rule of Thirds in every picture. The website shown above demonstrates the 
                    Rule of Thirds. You can see that the pictures above are pleasing to the eye, and are not perfectly centered. These images create balance, and demonstrate the Rule of Thrids very well.

                <h4>White Space and Clean Design</h4>
                <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/afc0dc5a-46fa-4c25-83f9-19e2c1fc37f0%2FIMG_2987.PNG?v=1632532233944" alt="space" />
                <h5>Hidden Valley Ranch</h5>
                <a href="https://www.hiddenvalley.com/?dmp=Brand&gclid=82cec929b0a710661ea1a867c6b3361f&gclsrc=3p.ds&msclkid=82cec929b0a710661ea1a867c6b3361f&utm_campaign=HVF|Branded|KW|Core|Exact&utm_content=Brand%20Core&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=bing&utm_term=Hidden%20Valley">hiddenvalley.com</a>
                <p>I chose to use the Hidden Valley Ranch page to demonstrate white space and a clean design. There is a lot of white space shown in the photo above. This white space has a good balance, and does not
                    feel too empty or crowded. This is one of the many goals web designers should have when making a website. This website feel very clean, and professional.
