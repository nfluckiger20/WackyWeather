            with different interests that both enjoy using Wacky Weather. <br><br>

            <h4>Mariah:</h4> <p>"Hi I am Mariah! I am 28 years old, and from Texas. I am a traveling photographer, and use wacky weather all the time. 
            Wacky Weather is super helpful when I am planning my vacations, this weather app helps me know what kind of weather I should plan
            for, and what kind of clothes I should bring with me."<br><br></p>

            <h4>Porter:</h4> <p>"Hi I'm Porter. I am from Oregon, and am almost 40. Weather patterns have always fascinated me. I check the weather multiple 
            times a day. Wacky Weather is one of my favorite ways to check weather patterns, and is usually fairly accurate. I also love predicting 
            future weather patterns, and then comparing my predictions with Wacky Weathers predictions. This is a great resource.<br><br></p>
