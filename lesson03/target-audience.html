        <h1>Target Audience</h1>
        <p>A target audience are people of different age groups with various interests. Here are two personas
            with different interests that both enjoy using Wacky Weather: <br><br>

            <h4>Mariah:</h4> "Hi I am Mariah! I am 28 years old, and from Texas. I am a traveling photographer, and use wacky weather all the time. 
            Wacky Weather is super helpful when I am planning my vacations, this weather app helps me know what kind of weather I should plan
            for, and what kind of clothes I should bring with me."<br><br>

            <h4>Porter:</h4> "Hi I'm Porter. I am from Oregon, and am almost 40. Weather patterns have always fascinated me. I check the weather multiple 
            times a day. Wacky Weather is one of my favorite ways to check weather patterns, and is usually fairly accurate. I also love predicting 
            future weather patterns, and then comparing my predictions with Wacky Weathers predictions. This is a great resource.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are several different scenarios that would help us understand the goal of the website better:<br><br>

            1) What is the weather/temperature for today?<br>
            2) How strong are the wind levels today? <br>
            3) What kind of weather should I expect tomorrow? <br>
            4) What kind of clothing should I wear this week? Is it warm enough for sandals? <br>
            5) Should I expect rain later today? <br>
